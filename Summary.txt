Iteration 1:
    All goals for this iteration were met.  We ran into some issues with JavaScript
    Libaries and testing.  The most difficult part for us was testing what we wrote.
    To fix these issues, we will focus on testing earlier on and not neglect it.
    We will also ask each other for help with testing if one is stuck.
